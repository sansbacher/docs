# Documentation and Information

* [Git for Small Teams or Single Devs](https://github.com/sansbacher/docs/tree/master/git) (with a Windows focus)
* Markdown - Coming soon
* Command Line (CLI) - Coming Soon
* PowerShell for Admins - Coming Later (I hope)

This is a just a place to store documentation and information I've written or collected. Instead of a website, it's on github.
