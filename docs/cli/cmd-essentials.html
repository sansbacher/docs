			</ul>

			<p>First: The "<b>Command Prompt</b>", as it is officially known in Windows, is the legacy CLI (though it isn't going
				anywhere) provided by CMD.EXE which resembles the MS-DOS Prompt (provided by COMMAND.COM). CMD.EXE provides some
				built-in commands, and others are external .EXE commands - but we'll consider anything provided my Microsoft in MS
				Windows to be "built-in".</p>
			<p>The CMD Command Prompt aka DOS Prompt carries a lot of <i>legacy baggage</i>, in fact most of the commands are made
				to operate identically to how they worked in MS-DOS, but with some enhancements. This is both a blessing and a
				curse.</p>
			<p>There's less uniform standardization and consistency with "DOS" commands (even ones provided by Microsoft with
				Windows, due to legacy reasons) but even less so with random Console .EXE files you may download and run. (though
				many are trying to follow modern Linux/Bash/macOS standards)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Generally I would recommend using PowerShell instead, but some commands may work better in the CMD Command
					Prompt, especially if they have switches requiring "quoted" values.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To start the <b>Command Prompt</b> run <code>cmd.exe</code>, or look for "Command Prompt" in your Start menu.</p>
			<p>Type commands at the <code class="console">C:\></code> prompt and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each.</p>

			<img src="images/cmd-console-example.png" alt="CMD.exe Command Prompt example" class="w3-round-small">
			<p></p>
			<div class="w3-container w3-theme-l4 w3-leftbar">
				<p>In the example above the command <code>cd "some folder"</code> was typed at the <code
						class="console">C:\></code> prompt, the prompt changed to show the working directory was changed to the
					"some folder" directory, a valid command was typed, the results came back (showing where the cmd.exe file is
					located), and then an unknown command was tried - resulting in the error message which says exactly that - the
					command wasn't recognized. Now the <code class="console">C:\some folder></code> prompt waits for the next
					command.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<hr>

			<h3 id="commands-options">Commands and Options</h3>

			<p>Included <b>Windows console commands</b> (both CMD built-in commands and external .EXE commands) are often short
				(<code>dir</code> instead of "<i>list directory</i>" or <code>md</code> instead of "<i>make directory</i>") and
				sometimes cryptic (such as <code>qwinsta</code> instead of "query windows station"); often because these commands
				have been around since the days of MS-DOS and 8 character filename limits. Generally there is no regular pattern
				all command names follow.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whereas <i>PowerShell</i> has cmdlets following Verb-Noun format (<code>Get-Content</code>,
					<code>Set-Content</code>, etc) CMD/DOS commands usually wrap all verb/action functionality into the same
					command, either using switches/options (like <code class="console">command.exe /add</code> or <code
						class="console">command.exe /remove</code>) or subcommands (like <code
						class="console">command.exe list</code> or <code class="console">command.exe edit -option</code>).</li>
				<li>PowerShell has aliases for many of these older DOS/CMD commands (such as <code>dir</code>, <code>copy</code>,
					<code>md</code>/<code>mkdir</code>, <code>ren</code>, <code>del</code>, etc) meaning if you learn these you'll
					be able to operate in both CLI Shells.</li>
				<li>All Command Prompt commands will output plain-text: what you see is exactly what is output.</li>
				<li>Third Party downloaded console commands may be equally short or cryptic, especially if they are ports of
					Linux/macOS/Bash utilities. You can also run Windows GUI commands which will just start the program as if you
					had double-clicked it (like <code>regedit.exe</code>) however some may also have useful switches/options.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Parameters/switches/options</b> for CMD/DOS Commands are separated from commands with a <kbd>Space</kbd> and
				usually a single dash <kbd>-</kbd> or slash <kbd>/</kbd>, as in <code class="console">-AH</code> or <code
					class="console">/B</code>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You need the space after the command and the dash or slash, you can't type <i>dir-ah</i> (that would be a
					separate command).</li>
				<li>CMD/DOS Commands can each have their own standard for options/switches, usually each set of switches is
					separated by a space:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Sometimes you add <i>values</i> after the switch, like: <code class="console">/a value</code></li>
					<li>Or you append it after a colon or equals, such as <code class="console">-a:value</code> or <code
							class="console">-a=value</code></li>
					<li>Sometimes you don't need any punctuation and you just add them together as in <code
							class="console">/ah</code> or <code class="console">/ahs</code> appending either <i>H</i> or <i>HS</i>
						to <i>/A</i><br>
						(In this case the switch is still <code class="console">/A</code>, the H or HS is just the value for <code
							class="console">/A</code>)</li>
					<li>Unix/Linux/Bash ported or inspired commands may use double dash <kbd>-</kbd><kbd>-</kbd> for some longer
						options like <code class="console">--listall</code></li>
					<li>And sometimes switches to be stacked/combined (where <code class="console">/a /o /n</code> can be written
						as <code class="console">/aon</code> or as <code class="console">/a/o/n</code> without spaces)</li>
					<li>Finally, some commands may not use a dash or slash and just have subcommands or options listed after the
						main command (such as <code>git status</code> not <i>/status</i> or <i>-status</i>)</li>
					<li>Or mix and match, such as: <code>git log --oneline -n 10</code><br>
						Note: <code>git</code> is the command for Git, the source code repository package. <code
							class="console">log</code> is a sub-command for Git. <code class="console">--oneline</code> is a
						parameter for the "Log" sub-command. And <code class="console">-n</code> is another option for Log with
						<code class="console">10</code> being the value passed to <code class="console">-n</code><br>
							For more info on using Git from the command line see my separate guide <a href="https://github.com/sansbacher/docs/tree/master/git">here</a>.</li>
					<li>Of course single letter switches can have different meanings to different commands...</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<div class="w3-container w3-theme-l4 w3-leftbar">
				<p>The main point is: <b>Every command can be different so check the help text!</b></p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<hr>

			<h3 id="get-help">Getting Help</h3>

			<p>Getting <b>Help</b> for CMD/DOS commands can also vary. A short list of the basic included Windows console commands
				can be found by running <code>help</code> but this by no means includes them all (mostly just the older legacy
				MS-DOS derived commands).</p>
			<p>Usually you need to pass a switch or option for DOS/CMD/Console .EXE commands to show their Help text. It can vary,
				but one of these should work:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code class="console">-h</code>, <code class="console">/h</code>, <code class="console">--help</code>, <code
						class="console">/?</code>, <code class="console">-?</code>, or just <code class="console">?</code></li>
				<li>As in <code>ping /?</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If the Help Text is too long add <code class="console">| more</code> after, as in: <code>chkdsk /? | more</code>
			</p>

			<p>Sometimes you can just type the command with <i>no</i> options and it will provide help, but sometimes the command
				doesn't require options and it just runs!
				<br>If this happens and it appears to hang (likely waiting for input) try pressing any of:
				<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to either cancel the
				command or end the input.</p>
			<p>While the <i>meaning</i> of console CLI switches/options/arguments can vary usually how they are represented in
				Help Text is fairly standard. </p>

			<img src="images/cmd-help-example.png" alt="CMD example help text from: copy /?" class="w3-round-small">
			<p></p>
			<div class="w3-container w3-theme-l4 w3-leftbar">
				<p>In the example above, <code>copy /?</code> shows there is only one required parameter, the <i>source</i> as it
					is not enclosed in <i>[square brackets]</i>. The other switches and options (such as <code
						class="console">/D</code>, <code class="console">/V</code>, etc) are in <i>[square brackets]</i> so they
					are optional, as is the <i>destination</i>.
					<br>If options are separated by a vertical pipe <kbd>|</kbd> character that means you can use only one of
					those options (either <code class="console">/A</code> or <code class="console">/B</code>). Then there is
					usually a list of what each option/switch means.
					<br>Whether you can specify options in lower case or use <kbd>-</kbd> instead of <kbd>/</kbd> depends on the
					command, sometimes if there isn't a <code class="console">/B</code> and a <code class="console">/b</code>
					option you can use either, other times not, other times they could be different options entirely!</p>
			</div>

			<br>

			<h3 id="also-worth-knowing">Also worth knowing</h3>

			<p>There's <b>Tab completion</b> only for files/directories at the CMD Command Prompt. Type a command and if you need
				to specify a file/folder start typing the name and press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to cycle through all matching
				files/folders. For example: type <code>cd \win[press TAB]</code> and it will complete to
				<code>cd C:\Windows</code></p>
			<p>Another trick you can sometimes use: the <kbd>*</kbd> wildcard. If it will match only one folder, as in
				<code>cd \win*</code>, it will resolve to the first folder starting with "win" in the root of the drive.</p>

			<p>The Command Prompt is (generally) <b>NOT Case Sensitive</b>. You can type <code>DIR</code>, <code>dir</code>,
				<code>DiR</code>, etc.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Files are also NOT Case Sensitive, though they do <i>retain</i> case (so test.txt = TEST.TXT = Test.TxT, they
					all reference the same file). Note: UNIX/Linux/macOS IS Case Sensitive.</li>
				However sometimes switches/parameters/options for external DOS/.EXE commands <i>are</i> case-sensitive!</p>
				<li>Because of the need to put <i>"quotes"</i> around files/folders with spaces in them you'll soon discover it's
					best to <i>avoid spaces in names if possible</i> (or use Tab Completion).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>To <b>run a script</b> you can just run it as any other built-in or external .EXE command, so long as it is in the
				<code class="console">PATH</code> it will be found.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> CMD scripts are ASCII text files that have a .BAT or .CMD extension (not .BATCH or .COM). Windows and most
					Email/AV/Spam filters will consider them executable so will be blocked from attachments; generally if you want
					to email a .BAT/.CMD file rename it to something like <i>filename_rename-me-BAT.txt</i> (but don't use
					.bat.txt in case the double extension is caught as suspicious too).</li>
				<li> The extension .BAT means "a file containing a <i>batch</i> of commands to run" and .CMD is for CMD, the
					command/shell processor.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can enter any CMD/DOS command at the prompt and test/build scripts one command at a time - that is: variables
				and whatnot persist between commands (but not between sessions - if you close the window everything not saved to a
				file is gone). However the Shell itself only has limited expression evaluation abilities, you can can't just type
				<i>2 + 2</i> and get back <i>4</i> like you can with PowerShell.</p>

				<p>CMD.EXE is a Windows program, so be mindful of <b>Run as Administrator</b>, Admin Rights, UAC, etc. If you
					can't do something, try running your Command Prompt as an Administrator.</p>
