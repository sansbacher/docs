<h1>Basic CLI Info and Guide - for Windows</h1>Many Command Line/CLI
guides exist, but often they target macOS or Linux where using Bash in
the Terminal is more common. Often the Command Line / CLI / DOS Prompt
/ PowerShell Console isn't as&nbsp;familiar for Windows Techs or Devs.
This is a guide I created for some people at my work a while back, so
they could get to grips with the basics of the Command Line on Windows.
If you are already familar with navigating around using CLI (Command
Line Interface) there's probably nothing new here. These days I would
recommend using PowerShell over the traditional CMD/DOS Console -
especially since PowerShell
has aliases for most DOS/Linux commands so you can just remember one
set of commands.. <br><br>This will mostly be a list of commands/things you should know, and a
suggested list of tasks to perform as a kind of "test" (with the
results provided so you can check if you're not sure). If you know most
of the things here (esp. the <a href="#Basic_Commands_you_should_know:">commands</a>)
you're good to go. If&nbsp;you're not sure then try a <a href="cli-tasktest.html">CLI Task Test</a>, if you can perform all the tasks then you're good to go (answers are also provided).<br>
<br>
If you <span style="font-style: italic;">can't</span> create or
change directories, copy/move/rename files using a Command Prompt
(PowerShell or otherwise) you should practice a bit; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a
longer, more complete CLI Crash Course</span> would be
<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">Zed's </span><a style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);" href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html" target="_blank">Appendix A</a><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 51);"> of his "Learn
Python
The Hard Way"</span> (works better in Chrome than IE, or try this <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html">link</a> if the first doesn't work). It's
designed for both
Windows PowerShell, macOS, and Linux and has 15 exercises with
practice tasks. <span style="font-style: italic;">Recommended</span>
if you've never really used the CLI - it's very much a "type it in and
you will learn it" guide, not just a list of commands. You can probably
find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGDV6SnbINlVUd0o2xT4JbMu" target="_blank">YouTube Tutorials</a> too. Spend a few
lunch hours learning to use the command prompt on your own PC, you
won't reget it!<br><br>NOTE: This is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
a PowerShell or DOS Batch file scripting guide, nor does it delve
indepth into using PowerShell (such as variables, objects, the
pipeline, etc). It's just for getting around the Command Prompt/CLI.
You'll probably learn this as you go (and become more confortable with
the CLI).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here's a tip</span>: Always have a Command Prompt or PowerShell window open, try to use the CLI first. And don't close it - you can run <br>
<h3>CLI things you should know:</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">powershell.exe</span>
to start PowerShell, or look in your Start Menu.</li>
<ul>
<li>Type commands at the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">PS C:\&gt;</span>
prompt and press [Enter] after each.</li><li>You
can generally run any DOS/CMD command (.EXE or .BAT file) in
PowerShell, plus newer PowerShell cmdlets, which are usually Verb-Nonu
in form, like Get-Content.</li><li>While you can run regular <span style="font-weight: bold;">external
command/EXE files</span>, like PING, IPCONFIG, ROUTE, etc from
PowerShell sometimes their options/switches cause issues if you need to "enclose things in quotes".</li>
</ul><li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">cmd.exe</span> to start the older "DOS" Command Prompt, or look for "Command Prompt" in your Start menu.</li><ul><li>Type commands at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\&gt;</span> prompt and press [Enter] after each.</li><li>Generally
I would recommend using PowerShell instead, but some commands may work
better in the CMD Command Prompt, especially if they have strange
switches.</li></ul>
<li>PowerShell commands are very verbose/long so most people
uses aliases for common commands (eg. using "<span style="font-weight: bold;">dir</span>" instead of "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ChildItem</span>").
Type <span style="font-weight: bold;">alias</span>
to see a list of all aliases. The aliases match the old DOS commands,
which are shorter, or are abreviations for longer PowerShell commands. There's also aliases for many Linux/Bash/macOS commands.</li>
<ul>
<li>I would only use standard/built-in aliases to ensure they
work on systems.</li>
</ul>
<li>There's&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Tab_completion"></a>Tab
completion</span> for both commands and
paramaters/switches/options, and files/directories. Start typing the
command or option and press the [Tab] key to cycle through all choices,
which even works for files.</li>
<ul>
<li>For example: Type <span style="font-weight: bold;">get-adu<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;press TAB&gt;</span></span>
and it will complete to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ADUser</span>
then type <span style="font-weight: bold;">-<span style="font-style: italic;">i&lt;press TAB&gt;</span></span>
and it will complete to <span style="font-weight: bold;">-Identity</span>
after which you can type a username. (assuming you're on a Server 2008
R2 or better Domain Controller)</li>
<li>Or type&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">cd
\win<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;press
TAB&gt;</span></span> and it will complete to&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">cd C:\Windows</span>.</li>
<li>Press TAB multiple times to cycle through various
options, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-AD<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;TAB several times&gt;</span></span>
will cycle through various AD related commads (eg. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ADComputer</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ADGroup</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ADUser</span>, etc).
Works for files / directories too!</li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paramaters/switches/options in PowerShell
</span>are specified after a command with a [Space] and a dash [-], eg.
<span style="font-style: italic;">-Identity</span>. You need the space
after the command and the dash, you can't type Get-ADUser-Identity
(that would be a single long command). Spaces separate options from
commands. There's usually also a space after the option if you need to
provide a <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span>,
like a username or something. But there's no space after the dash, so this wouldn't work: <span style="font-style: italic;">- i</span></li>
<ul>
<li>Many common switches/options can be abrevated (shorten
them enough to make them unique) and some can be skipped if they are
implied by being manatory based on their location (eg. you can skip -Identity with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ADUser</span> and just
type <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ADUser <span style="font-style: italic;">username</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>as Identity is
assumed to be the first paramater).</li>
</ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paramaters/switches/options for DOS/CMD commands (.EXE files)</span> can vary, regardless of using the CMD prompt or PowerShell. The most common cases are:</li><ul><li>A single dash, like <span style="font-weight: bold;">-i</span>, but sometimes a forward shash such as: <span style="font-weight: bold;">/i</span>. Sometimes you can stack single character options, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">-abc</span> instead of <span style="font-weight: bold;">-a -b -c</span> as separate options</li><li>Double dashes usually for longer-named-options, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">--do-something</span></li><li>And sometimes you just use an option, such as: <span style="font-weight: bold;">list</span></li><li>A command like git.exe may use all 3: &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">git log --oneline -n 10</span></li><ul><li>'git'
is the command for git.exe. 'log' is a sub-command for git. '--oneline'
is a parameter. '-n' is another option with '10' being the value passed
to -n.</li></ul></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting Help</span>: In PowerShell you type <span style="font-weight: bold;">help</span> and then cmdlet you want help for, such as: <span style="font-weight: bold;">help Get-Process, </span>add&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">-full</span> to see all the details and examples:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">help Get-Process -full</span></li><ul><li>For DOS/CMD/Console .EXE commands it can vary, but one of these should work:</li><li>-h, /h, --help, /?, -?, or just ?</li><li>As in <span style="font-weight: bold;">ping /?</span></li><li>Sometimes
you can just type the command with no options and it will provide help,
but sometimes the command doesn't require options and it just runs!</li><ul><li>If
this happens and it appears to hang (likely waiting for input) try
pressing any of: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, or Ctrl+D to either cancel the command
or end the input.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></li></ul></ul>
<li>The Command Prompt is (generally) <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT Case Sensitive</span>.
You can type DIR, dir, DiR, etc. General PowerShell commands are
written in CamelCase with words&nbsp;smooshed together using
CapitalsToSeparateWords for readability, usually starting with a verb, as in: Get-SomeThingYouWant, or Remove-ThingYouDont.</li>
<ul>
<li>Files are also NOT Case Senitive, though they do retain
case (so test.txt = TEST.TXT = Test.TxT, they all reference the same
file). Note: UNIX/Linux/mcOS IS Case Sensitive.</li><li>However sometimes switches/paramters/options for external DOS/.EXE commands <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> case-sensitive!</li>
</ul>
<li>Because of the need to put "quotes" around
commands/files/folders with spaces in them you'll soon discover it's
best to <span style="font-weight: bold;">avoid spaces in
names</span> if possible (or use Tab Completion).</li>
<li>To <span style="font-weight: bold;">run a
script</span> you need to specify the path, if you are in the
same directory you still have to specify the current directory, eg:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">.\test-script.ps1</span>.
You can use Tab Completion to start typing the name
and press TAB and it will complete the filename along with the ".\"
before it.</li>
<ul>

<li>PowerShell
scripts are text files that have a .PS1 extension (not .PS, that's
PostScript printer files). Windows and most Email/AV/Spam filters will
consider them executable so will be blocked from attachments; generally
if you want to email a .PS1 file rename it to something like <span style="font-style: italic;">filename-rename-mePS1.txt </span>(but
don't use .ps1.txt in case the double extension is caught as suspecious
too).</li><li>DOS/CMD
scripts are also text files, but have the extension .BAT (for files
containing a batch of commands to run) or .CMD (for CMD, the command
processor).</li>
</ul>
<li>Before you can run any script the ExecutionPolicy must be
RemoteSigned or Unrestricted. If you get an error running a script type:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Set-ExecutionPolicy
RemoteSigned</span></li><li>PowerShell is a Windows program, so be mindful of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Run as Administrator</span>,
Admin Rights, UAC, etc. If you can't do something, try running your
PowerShell prompt as an Administrator.</li>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using the
PowerShell Prompt:</span></h3>
There are several <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff678293.aspx" target="_blank">Keyboard Shortcuts</a> that are worth
knowing, they make using the CLI <span style="font-style: italic;">much
more pleasent and efficient</span>,
especially when correcting mistakes or building commands up by adding
more options/commands. Most are the same as DOS/CMD. You don't need to
memorize them all, but the ones worth learning are:<br>

File System Commands you should know:</h3>
Here's the basic file system commands you should know, these are the <span style="font-weight: bold;">aliases</span> for the
actual PowerShell commands. I don't know anyone who types <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get-ChildItem</span> and
while you may see the short alias <span style="font-weight: bold;">gci
</span>occationally (especially on Microsoft blogs) most people
type <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir</span>
(or <span style="font-weight: bold;">ls</span> if
they are Linux/UNIX users) because it's what we typed in DOS or the CMD
Command Prompt.&nbsp;Most of these you could use in a CMD prompt,
so there's
a double benefit to learning them!<br>

Seems overwhelming if
you're new to using the CLI, I know. But you will have a much easier
time with PowerShell if you are semi-comfortable with using the CLI
interface. I also have&nbsp;a sort of play-by-play <a href="CLITaskTest.html">CLI Task Test</a> you
can try: a list of very basic CLI tasks to try - along with an answer
list showing what to type to do them all (you can use PowerShell on
your own PC). If you feel like you need extra practice then I strongly
suggest Zed's <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html" target="_blank">CLI Crash Course</a>, mentioned above.
You can keep this page open as a quick reference.<br><h3>Some Common Console Commands worth knowing:</h3>Here's
some common/useful Console commands worth knowing that you may use
while at a Command Prompt. These will work in DOS/CMD or PowerShell as
they are external commands. You don't need to type them in using ALL

with a PowerShell alias (eg. SC.EXE is an external command [Service
Controller] but SC is a PowerShell alias for Set-Content [write text to
a file]. Typing "sc" at a PowerShell prompt is the same as typing
Set-Content, but typing "sc.exe" will runn the Service Controller

Runas lets you start a process as another user.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 201px;">NOTEPAD</td><td style="width: 595px;">Not a command line tool, but if you are editing scripts then <span style="font-weight: bold;">notepad scriptFile.ps1</span> is important.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 201px;">MSIEXEC</td><td style="width: 595px;">The MSI Installer Tool, eg: <span style="font-weight: bold;">msiexec /i someProgram.msi /qn /norestart /log logFile.txt</span></td></tr><tr><td>REG</td><td>View, Set, Change, Import, Export Registry Values or whole Keys.</td></tr><tr><td>SHUTDOWN</td><td>Shutdown or Restart the computer, eg: <span style="font-weight: bold;">shutdown /r&nbsp;/t 30</span> you can use <span style="font-weight: bold;">/a</span> to abort!</td></tr><tr><td>FC</td><td>File Compare to see if two files are identical. With text files it shows you the differences.</td></tr><tr><td>ATTRIB</td><td>View, Set or Clear file attrributes, including Read Only, Hidden and System</td></tr><tr><td>XCOPY and ROBOCOPY</td><td>Advanced Copy commands that can copy while file/folder trees including permissions</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 201px;">GIT</td><td style="width: 595px;">The Git source code revision control system command (if installed). Full info on using Git <a href="https://github.com/sansbacher/docs/tree/master/git" target="_blank">here</a>.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 201px;">FINDSTR or FIND</td><td style="width: 595px;">When the output of a command is too long you can | (pipe) it to <span style="font-weight: bold;">findstr</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">find</span> filter based on some text string. <span style="font-style: italic;">Don't</span> use find in PowerShell, in fact in PowerShell you probably want to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">Where</span> anyway. But findstr works in both, eg: <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir \ | findstr /I "Windows"</span></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 201px;">SORT and MORE</td><td style="width: 595px;">Other
commands you can | (pipe) output to, to sort the output or page it one
screen at a time - press the [Space] bar for more, eg: <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir \windows | more</span> and then press [Space] or "q" to quit.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<h3>Important CLI symbols:</h3>
There's a few other things you need to know to get around using the
Command Line effectively, especially some of the symbols. Again many of
these
are applicable to the regular CMD Command Prompt as well. You won't
need to know/use all of these just now <span style="font-style: italic;">but the more comon ones are near
the top</span>.<br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; height: 456px; width: 855px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="height: 35px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; .
&nbsp;(dot)</td>
<td style="height: 35px; width: 725px;">The . (dot / period)
represents the
<span style="font-style: italic;">current</span>
directory; thus .\file2.txt means the <span style="font-style: italic;">file2.txt</span> in the
directory you are in.<br>
If you are IN c:\temp\folder1\folder2 then . means folder2, and
.\file2.txt means <span style="font-style: italic;">c:\temp\folder1\folder2\file2.txt</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; ..
&nbsp;(doubledot)</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The .. (double dots)
represents the <span style="font-style: italic;">parent</span>
directory (one level up). You can <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd
..</span> to move up a directory.<br>
If you are IN c:\temp\folder1\folder2 then .. means folder1, and ..\file<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>1.txt means <span style="font-style: italic;">c:\temp\folder1\file1.txt</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;(backslash)</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The \ (backslash)
represent the <span style="font-style: italic;">root</span>
directory of the drive. It's also used to separate directories and
files.<br>
If you are IN c:\temp\folder1\folder2 then \ means c:\,
and&nbsp;\file3.txt means <span style="font-style: italic;">c:\file3.txt</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; ~ &nbsp;
(tilde)</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">In PowerShell the ~ (tilde) represents
YOUR <span style="font-style: italic;">home</span>
directory, wherever that is. If you are logged in as bsmith then ~\Desktop means <span style="font-style: italic;">c:\users\bsmith\Desktop.&nbsp;</span>It doesn't do anything in CMD/DOS (except for fancy variable stuff)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; #
&nbsp;(hash)</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">Does nothing in DOS/CMD, but in PowerShell the # symbol starts a
Comment which is ignored in scripts. In DOS batch file use <span style="font-style: italic;">REM</span>. &nbsp;<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;#</span></big>
long
comments can cross lines and are enclosed with opening and closing sets
of sumbols <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">#&gt;&nbsp;</span></big></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; |
&nbsp;(pipe)</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The | (pipe) is used to
send the output of one command as the input of the next command. While CMD supports this PowerShell uses it a lot, eg: <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir
|&nbsp;select Name, Length | fl</span> &nbsp;(<span style="font-weight: bold;">dir</span>'s output goes
into <span style="font-weight: bold;">select</span>
which goes into <span style="font-weight: bold;">fl</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; &gt;
&nbsp;(greater)</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The &gt; (greater than
sign) is used to send the output of a comand into a text file, eg. <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir &gt; file.txt</span>.
This is the "cheap" way of saving output, Use
&gt;&gt; (2 greater signs) to <span style="font-style: italic;">append</span> output,
as using just one (&gt;) <span style="font-style: italic;">overwrites</span>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; *
&nbsp;(star)<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The * (or asterisk) is
used as a simple <span style="font-style: italic;">wildcard</span>,
it represents <span style="font-style: italic;">any number of characters.</span> So <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir
*cat.txt</span> finds all TXT files that ends in cat (eg.
tomcat.txt, nicecat.txt, but not catalog.txt).<span style="font-style: italic;"> *cat*.txt</span> would
find anything with "cat" in the file name like tomcat2.txt<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; ?
&nbsp;(question)<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The ? (question mark) is
used as a simple <span style="font-style: italic;">wildcard,</span>
it represents <span style="font-style: italic;">any ONE
character.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>Not
used as much as *.<br>
But you will see it used as an abreviation for the "where" command in PowerShell.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; %
&nbsp;(percent)<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">In DOS/CMD % (percent sign) is used around variables, like %windir%. In PowerShell the % (percent sign) is
used as an abreviation for the "foreach" command.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; $
&nbsp;(dollar)<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">Not unsed in DOS/CMD, but in PowerShell the $ (dollar sign) is
used to start a variable name, so <span style="font-weight: bold;">$AllUsers</span>
is a variable that might hold "all users", so is <span style="font-weight: bold;">$_</span> which is the implied pipeline variable.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;-
&nbsp;(dash)<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The - (dash) is used to
start all options/paramaters/switches on commands. So <span style="font-style: italic;">-Identity</span> denotes
the Idenity parameter.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">" and ' (quotes)<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The " (double quote) and '
(single quote) are used to enclose strings of characters. <span style="font-style: italic;">My File.txt</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> would be two
items, but "<span style="font-style: italic;">My File.txt</span>"
is a single item. Use "double quotes" most often, esp. if you want
variables to show their values in PS.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;;
&nbsp;(semicolon)<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The ; (semicolon) is used
to separate commands on the same line in PowerShell. So insead of <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd \ (</span><span style="font-style: italic;">press enter)</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir </span>(press enter)
you can type <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd \ ; dir</span>
and PowerShell will execute both (change to the root and show the
contents of the root).<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td style="width: 112px;">&nbsp;&amp; (ampersand)</td><td style="width: 725px;">Is the command separator in DOS/CMD (so <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd \ &amp; dir</span>
would be two separate commands on one line). In PowerShell it
invokes/starts a command or script, especially one with a space in the
name.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;` (backtick) or<br>^ (caret)</td><td>These
are "escape" characters, which means the shell ignores the next
character's special meaning, use the backtick (`) in PowerShell to
escape and the caret (^) in CMD/DOS to escape the next character.</td></tr><tr>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 112px;">&nbsp;( ) [ ] { }<br>
</td>
<td style="height: 46px; width: 725px;">The various brackets:
(parentheses), [square
brackets], and {curly braces} are used for various things by PowerShell
(mainly). The main thing is that they come in matching sets, and are
not interchangable. (something] won't work.<br>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
That's about it. We've learned some basics of the PowerShell CLI,
important and useful keystrokes, commands, and symbols.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Don't forget to find a PowerShell editor, such as PowerShell ISE,
Notepad++, Notepad2, etc!<br>
