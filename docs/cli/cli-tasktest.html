<body><h1>PowerShell for Admins - CLI Task Test</h1>
If you're wondering if you have enough CLI (command line interface)
skills to work with PowerShell and files/folders within PowerShell then
you can use this Task Test to see if you can accomplishing some basic
tasks. If you have basic DOS/CMD Command Prompt knowledge you'll
probably find you can use the same commands in PowerShell (there are
standard aliases for most of them). If you need a more thorough
run-through of the CLI then I suggest Zed's <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html" target="_blank">Appendix A</a>. You can also keep the <a href="BasicCLI-Info.html" target="_blank">Basic CLI Info</a> page open as a reference.<br><br>Follow through these tasks and try to accomplish them all via the PowerShell command line, refer to the <a href="BasicCLI-Info.html" target="_blank">Basic CLI Info</a> (all of the commands you need are on that page), or google for help. <a href="#Were_you_successful">At the end</a>
is a link to a page showing what you could type to complete each task -
if you're stuck you can also check there. These may all seem like
trivial tasks, but that that's the point: you just need some basic CLI
skills to make operating in PowerShell&nbsp;much easier. Good luck!<br><h3><a name="CLITaskTestStart"></a>Start here:</h3><ol><li>Open <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows PowerShell</span>, what folder&nbsp;are you in? What version of PowerShell<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>are you running?</li><li>Change to the <span style="font-style: italic;">root</span> of the drive, create a folder called&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Playground</span> and change into it.</li><li>Create a file called&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">example.txt</span> and put whatever you want in it (using Notepad or whatever editor you like)</li><li>Create two sub-folders called: <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span>.</li><li>List what's in the Playground folder.</li><li>Copy <span style="font-style: italic;">example.txt</span> into <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder1</span>, and change to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder1</span> directory.</li><li>Create a file called <span style="font-style: italic;">file.txt</span> with the contents: <span style="font-style: italic;">write your PowerShell code here!&nbsp;</span>(using Notepad or whatever editor)</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>Copy <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">file.txt</span></span> to <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span> and delete <span style="font-style: italic;">example.txt</span> from <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder1</span>.</li><li>Change to <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span>.</li><li>Rename <span style="font-style: italic;">file.txt</span> to <span style="font-style: italic;">file.ps1</span>. Try to run <span style="font-style: italic;">file.ps1</span> - what happens? If it doesn't work read the errors as they should tell you what to try. If it does something, why?</li><li>Chack back to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Playground</span> folder.</li><li>Create a file called <span style="font-style: italic;">Long Name.txt</span> (with a space) and put whatever you want in it (using whatever editor you like)</li><li>Look at what is in side of it and then rename it to&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">tiny.txt</span>.</li><li>Move <span style="font-style: italic;">tiny.txt</span> to <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span>. Change to <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span>.</li><li>Make two copies of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">tiny.txt</span>, one as <span style="font-style: italic;">temp.txt</span> and one as <span style="font-style: italic;">test.txt.</span></li><li>Show<span style="font-style: italic;"> all</span> the files in the current folder, show only the files that <span style="font-style: italic;">start with the letter T</span>, and also show all the <span style="font-style: italic;">.PS1 files</span>.</li><li>Confirm you are in <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span> and then delete all files in <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2.</span> Is <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span> empty now?</li><li>Change back one folder level and remove <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder2</span>.</li><li>Remove <span style="font-style: italic;">Folder1</span>.</li><li>See if any files are left, if so delete them.

to&nbsp;see a transcript of all the commands I typed to complete the
Tasks (and the results). You may have used slightly differnet ones,
that's OK - so long as you were able to accomplish each Task. If you
